Teacher's Questions:
  1. Who is the customer?
  2. The customer-development partnership.
  3. Creating a culture that respects requirement.

  4. Identifying decision makers.
  5. Reaching agreement on requirements.
  Customers often don’t have the time or patience
to participate in requirements activities. In many cases, project participants don’t
even agree on what a “requirement” is. As one writer observed, “Engineers would
rather  decipher the words to the Kingsmen’s 1963 classic party song ‘Louie Louie’ than
 decipher customer requirements” (Peterson 2002)
    Software requirements are the foundation of any software development project. They define what the software should do, how it should behave, and what value it should deliver to the users and the business. However, software requirements are not always clear, consistent, or agreed upon by all the stakeholders involved in the project. This can lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, delays, and rework. How do you ensure stakeholder agreement on software requirements?
  First, many undergraduate curricula in software engineering and  computer
science continue to underemphasize the importance of requirements engineering
(which encompasses both requirements development and requirements  management).
And second, those of us in the software domain tend to be enamored with  technical
and process solutions to our challenges. We sometimes fail to appreciate that
 requirements elicitation—and much of software and systems project work in general—
is primarily a human interaction challenge.
Software development involves at least as much communication as it does
computing, yet both educational curricula and project activities often emphasize
the computing over the communication aspect.
    -Write high-quality requirements from the outset of a project, thereby
 minimizing rework and maximizing productivity.
    -Deliver high-quality information systems and commercial products that achieve
their business objectives.
    -Manage scope creep and requirements changes to stay both on target and
under control.
    -Achieve higher customer satisfaction.
    -Reduce maintenance, enhancement, and support costs.
  Common  problem areas are informal information gathering, implied functionality, miscommunicated
 assumptions, poorly specified requirements, and a casual change process. Various studies suggest
that errors introduced during requirements activities account for 40 to 50 percent of all defects
found in a software product (Davis 2005)
  Handled well, this intersection can lead to delighted customers and fulfilled developers.
Handled poorly, it’s the source of misunderstanding and friction that undermine the product’s quality
and business value. Because requirements are the foundation for both the software development and
the project management activities, all stakeholders should commit to applying requirements practices
that are known to yield superior-quality products

Constructive Questions.

  1. What is a perspective on the software?
  2. Why is important the agreement on requirements.
